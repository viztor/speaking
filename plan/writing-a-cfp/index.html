    <h1>
      <a href="index.html">Writing the CFP</a>
    </h1>

    <p>A lot of conferences will require you to submit a Call For Papers, or CFP, which
means you&rsquo;re going to have to take this half-baked idea you have and add a bunch
of words to it even though the conference probably won&rsquo;t happen until six months
from now and how the hell are you supposed to finalize this already do you know
how much can change in six months I could be dead did you think about that,
conference? I could be dead, dammit.</p>

<p>Luckily the conference will probably happen whether you are alive or not, so
it&rsquo;s best to play by their rules and submit them a Paper, whatever that means.</p>

<h2>What is a CFP?</h2>

<p>This goes back to academia, where people had Important Academic Papers to
disseminate amongst the intelligentsia. Compare that to your slides, which
probably have an actual picture of poop in them. We&rsquo;re clearly in over our heads
already.</p>

<p>But like the good lord says, fake it until you make it, so take a step and see
what the CFP entails. Usually it&rsquo;s just a paragraph or two for your talk
abstract, a paragraph or two directly to the conference organizers, and then
maybe special things like your Social Media Network Handle so that they can be
sure the conference has lots of Social Media in it.</p>

<h2>Writing the abstract</h2>

<p>The important thing about writing the CFP talk abstract is that this will
probably be what they put in the conference program about your talk. So that
puts you in the particularly strange situation where if you change your talk in
the subsequent few months, you might still have a really inaccurate talk
description.</p>

<p>Two things: keep it abstract, and keep it interesting. I use the <em>abstract</em> part
of <em>talk abstract</em> literally: I try not to include too many specific details to
give me some leeway to let the talk take me where it wants to go later when I
build it. You can&rsquo;t be too amorphous to the extent where you&rsquo;re not saying
anything, otherwise the organizers won&rsquo;t pick it, but you can talk in more
broader themes than you would otherwise.</p>

<p>Also, keep it interesting. As I said, this will probably be in the talk program,
and if the conference you&rsquo;re presenting at has multiple tracks, you&rsquo;ll want to
write something interesting enough to pull people in and choose your talk.</p>

<h2>Writing the note to organizers</h2>

<p>Some CFPs will let you include a quick, private note to the conference
organizers. You can put anything you want in here, but be brief (organizers are
busy, busy people), and it might be a good idea to talk more honestly about why
you think giving this talk is really important to conference attendees. That&rsquo;s
really the kicker (and it should show through in your abstract as well). People
want to be moved by interesting, new perspectives, even if they don&rsquo;t
necessarily agree with them at the onset. Differentiate yourself, include some
humor, and you&rsquo;ll fare well.</p>
